# ConverTex
The purpose of the component is to render mathematical equations and the like in the LaTeX language in the articles, to add an easy-to-use equation editor in creating the article, making it easier to enter the equations without needing prior LaTeX knowledge.

## Under development
The component is in development and some parts are not yet accessible.
As we are in the testing phase, we do not offer support outside the project, but we can discuss ways to improve the tool.

## Considerations
The component was created to the [Triki](https://triki.ufop.br/) extension project of the [Federal University of Ouro Preto](https://ufop.br/), under the coordination of Professor [Armando de Oliveira Brizola](http://lattes.cnpq.br/6035125726070491) ([DEFIS](https://fisica.ufop.br/) - [UFOP](https://ufop.br/)).
